# X balls of 1 pixel will fall one by one from the top of the grid to the 
# bottom. A platform of 3 pixels large is positioned at the bottom line and can
# move left or right. Each ball will be green or red with equal probability.
# The platform has to catch the green balls but not the red ones.

# inputs :  chromosome of length 2*(N-1)*(2*(N-1)+1) : rules to play
#           N : len of side of grid
#           lbd : paramter lambda

# g  g  g  g  .... g  g  g .... r r r r
# y1 y1 y1 y1 .... y2 y2 y2
# x1 x2 x3 x4 .... x1 x2 x3 
# with possible values -1 (move left) or 1 (move 1)
# should work also if we add 0 (stay still)

# output : average fitness of the chromosome after 100 balls
